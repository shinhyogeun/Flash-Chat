## Opinion

This is for chatting app. so i have to use firebase and cocoapods etc. this is my first useag of that functions. so there are some flaw in my code. and i learn this part in udemy academy. and i start to use github about a week ago so i don't know exactly how to update and how to rename and restucture my repository.So after short day, i will learn about git&github so then i will make github file more clear. And if you want to give me a advice, i really thanks about it.
